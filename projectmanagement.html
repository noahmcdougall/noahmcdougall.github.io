During the winter months when surface drilling is unfavorable, we build plans and targets for the upcoming year. We spend the rest of the year executing that plan. Because Nyrstar is a low budget mining operation, I am very hands-on in my projects. Any given day, I may begin by preparing a proposed capital budget presentation only to later don my PPE and operate a telehandler (big fork lift) to ensure the logging process doesn't get bottlenecked. All of my work relies on solid data collection procedures, progress reporting, and data analysis to make informed decisions and keep on track. This page highlights some examples of things I've worked on. Please note that all figures contain fictional numbers in order to maintain confidentiality.</p></div><div class="col-full"><div class="col-half"><div class="hlp1-1"></div><div class="hlp1-2"></div></div><div class="col-half order-first"><h2>Historic Logging Project - Phase I - Initiation</h2><hr/><p>About 80% of Middle Tennessee Mine's geologic information has never been entered into a database, and instead it exists as graphic logs in binders.  This makes it incredibly difficult for data analysis and modeling.  No one had a good estimate of what it would take to digitize the data, and thus it was very difficult to secure funding. During a slow time in our exploration drilling, I started data mining and preparing for Phase I of the project - scoping.</p><p>Starting out, I used SQL to export all the geologic and collar information for our area of interest from the database and organized the holes by HOLEID, PROJECTCODE, and DEPTH.  Using my favorite Excel formula, SumProduct, I tallied how much footage had been logged from each HOLEID and how much was remaining.</p><p>Next, I wanted to take inventory of what information we had to digitize.  A colleague of mine took inventory of the physical graphic logs we had.  I used Excel formulas to create a list of .pdf file names within our folder structures for the graphic logs that had previously been scanned.  Comparing the two lists, I delegated scanning the missing logs and organizing them into our folder structure.</p><p>It became clear that we did not have a physical or scanned copy of many holes.  When plotting these holes out spatially, it was clear that not all data was received during the acquisition of Cumberland mine from previous owners.  My colleague who had taken inventory of the paper logs found a clue in the form of contact information for the now defunct minerals division of the previous owner.  He set off on trying to track down the missing information.  This means the project had to plan around a possible inflation of 30% in scope.</p></div></div><div class="col-full"><div class="col-half"><h2>Historic Logging Project - Phase II - Planning</h2><hr/><p>At this point, we had a fair idea of the hurdle ahead of us, but no clue about the realistic pace it would take to digitize it.  At this point, we prioritized the HOLEIDs spatially, and divvied them up amongst our Exploration team for Phase II - planning.  I had built a logging excel sheet for each person that would import easily into our database, but also had some extra features.  Data validation kept users from making simple mistakes, and cross referencing some existing geologic information about marker beds ensured that the loggers were guided in their interpretations.  Each individual logging sheet was connected to a Status Sheet which gave HOLEID assignments, real time project status updates, and helpful charts and statistics to gauge a realistic pace.</p><p>We came out of this feasibility study with the information needed to put together a cost for completing the entire project and an idea of some of the issues we'd face by contracting this work out.  Our team started putting together training files, and I consulted with HR about the expected pay and hiring process.  With this information, I was able to put together an Excel sheet to test parameters, such as pay, organizational structure for QC, and hiring rate to discuss with my manager.  Using this information, we were able to put together a budget proposal and timeline for the project.  It was greenlit soon after.</p></div><div class="col-half"><div class="hlp2-1"></div><div class="hlp2-2"></div></div></div><div class="col-full"><div class="col-half"><div class="hlp3-1"></div></div><div class="col-half order-first"><h2>Historic Logging Project - Phase III Execution</h2><hr/><p>With the appropriate funding, we were able to start hiring people for phase III - execution.  I started reaching out to universities, designed fliers, and worked with HR to get the position promoted on job seeking websites.  We preferred applicants that were students wanting to build up their geologic resume or local members of the community that could benefit from part-time work with a flexible schedule.  I kept track of all the applicants and their statuses, and delegated different portions of the onboard training to other members of the Exploration team.  Google Drive was used to distribute the scanned logs, and a system of time reporting and documentation made sure the contractors were paid.  I built a timestamp into the loggers' excel sheets via VBA to have a method of reconciling the reported hours.  Loggers were assigned to members of the Exploration team for QC, and we planned to promote high-performing loggers to QC leads.</p><p>We provided continuous feedback to the loggers and watched them become very proficient.  We found no correlation between geologic or data entry background and their performance.  We had to let some underperforming loggers go along the way, but we had some real stars as well.  A few months into the project, Nyrstar was undergoing some major corporate transformations since it was bought out by Trafigura.  Unfortunately, nearly all of the Exploration department's funding was cut, and the historic logging project had to be ended prematurely at ~20% completion.  We had made a significant dent in the missing geologic information, and all files were archived in order to restart the project in the future.</p></div></div><div class="col-full"><div class="col-half"><h2>Drilling Bid Renewals</h2><hr/><p>I haven't filled this out yet.

Nyrstar would always end up bearing the cost of re-collaring holes, because they had no proof of the long-held argument of drilling rate/deviation. Through data mining, I determined neither party was exactly correct. A simple solution of changing the location of the stabilizer on the rod configuration cut down on hole deviations while still allowing the drilling contractor to maintain their preferred drilling rate.</p></div><div class="col-half"><div class="drillingdeviation-1"></div></div></div><div class="col-full"><div class="col-half"><h2>Performance Monitoring</h2><hr/><p>I haven't filled this out yet.

To get an idea of guest count, Alice and I made a list of all those who we plan to invite and gave them a ranking of their likelihood of attending.  I ran Monte Carlo simulations to get the statistics of how many guests and the breakdown of adults vs kids.  This was really overkill for what we needed, but I enjoy this kind of stuff.</p></div><div class="col-half"><div class="wedding-1"></div></div></div></section>
