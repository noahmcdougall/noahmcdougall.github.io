It was hard to find the time to dedicate to learning Python when I could easily complete the same task way faster elsewhere.  In my spare time, I chose to set off on a project from my graduate studies, the GeoStriker.  Geologists are taught how to complete 'three point problems' in undergrad.  Given three points, we have to calculate the strike and dip of the plane that connects them.  However, in the real world we collect more than three points.  In my case, I had hundreds of XYZ pairs from an exported fault that I had interpreted in 3D software.  How do you reconcile more than three points?  That's where the GeoStriker comes in.  It's a nifty calculator that determines the best-fit plane to a point cloud, and then gets the strike and dip of that plane.</p><p> </p>GeoStriker, originally called XYZ to SD calculator, has been through MANY iterations.  It started as an Excel sheet and took me months to get into a working calculator with the help of my friend Matthew Lenz.  Just getting the code to calculate it was the first step though.  Building an interface so that the app was accessable to anyone was the most difficult part.  Eventually I got it hosted on a free website, of which I don't even remember the name.  A year later, that website decided to get rid of their free service.  Luckily, by this time I had already started another project and knew a little bit about web hosting and design.  It still took me a while to figure out how to host it for free on Google's cloud services.  While making that transition, I gave the website a much needed makeover.  You can find the app here:<a href="www.geostriker.com">www.geostriker.com</a>.</div><div class="col-half"><div class="placeholderpic"></div></div></div><div class="col-full"><div class="col-half"><div class="placeholderpic"></div></div><div class="col-half order-first"><h2>Under Construction</h2><hr/><p>Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder Place holder</p></div></div></section>
